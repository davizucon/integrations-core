            The Datadog Agent can collect many metrics from NGINX instances, including (but not limited to)::

            - Total requests
            - Connections (e.g. accepted, handled, active)

            For users of NGINX Plus, the commercial version of NGINX, the Agent can collect the significantly more metrics that NGINX Plus provides, like:

            - Errors (e.g. 4xx codes, 5xx codes)
            - Upstream servers (e.g. active connections, 5xx codes, health checks, etc.)
            - Caches (e.g. size, hits, misses, etc.)
            - SSL (e.g. handshakes, failed handshakes, etc.)

            The NGINX check pulls metrics from a local NGINX status endpoint, so your `nginx` binaries need to have been compiled with one of two NGINX status modules:

            - [stub status module][2] - for open source NGINX
            - [http status module][3] - only for NGINX Plus
            [2]: https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_stub_status_module.html
            [3]: https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_status_module.html

                If you use open source NGINX, your instances may lack the stub status module. Verify that your `nginx` binary includes the module before proceeding to **Configuration**:
                ```shell
                $ nginx -V 2>&1| grep -o http_stub_status_module
                http_stub_status_module
                ```

                If the command output does not include `http_stub_status_module`, you must install an NGINX package that includes the module. You _can_ compile your own NGINX-enabling the module as you compile it-but most modern Linux distributions provide alternative NGINX packages with various combinations of extra modules built in. Check your operating system's NGINX packages to find one that includes the stub status module.
