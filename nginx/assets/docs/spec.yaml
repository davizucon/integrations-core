            The Datadog Agent can collect many metrics from NGINX instances, including (but not limited to)::

            - Total requests
            - Connections (e.g. accepted, handled, active)

            For users of NGINX Plus, the commercial version of NGINX, the Agent can collect the significantly more metrics that NGINX Plus provides, like:

            - Errors (e.g. 4xx codes, 5xx codes)
            - Upstream servers (e.g. active connections, 5xx codes, health checks, etc.)
            - Caches (e.g. size, hits, misses, etc.)
            - SSL (e.g. handshakes, failed handshakes, etc.)
